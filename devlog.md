a. This is my first addition to the devlog for project 3. As of now, I have watched the project over video and I just created my github repository. Now I need to think about coding the project itself. Look at the project 3 document, I'm not really sure where to start just because its a command line program and there is no demo code. 
b. This project session I plan to do some research on creating a command line program. I plan to create the necessary files I need and begin my code.

a. I am continuing this project session. I decided to setup a main project3 file with a class and main function, and the command line arguments will be the commands. This way the program will run like the previous 2 projects. I also looked at the what the program is doing itself, which is using a B Tree for indexing. I understand this concept as I recently learned about this in Databases in addition to OS so logically I think I understand what it's doing.
b. This project session I plan to write the code that takes in commands and sends the program to the corresponding function.
