a. This is my first addition to the devlog for project 3. As of now, I have watched the project over video and I just created my github repository. Now I need to think about coding the project itself. Look at the project 3 document, I'm not really sure where to start just because its a command line program and there is no demo code. 
b. This project session I plan to do some research on creating a command line program. I plan to create the necessary files I need and begin my code.
