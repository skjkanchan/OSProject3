a. This is my first addition to the devlog for project 3. As of now, I have watched the project over video and I just created my github repository. Now I need to think about coding the project itself. Look at the project 3 document, I'm not really sure where to start just because its a command line program and there is no demo code. 
b. This project session I plan to do some research on creating a command line program. I plan to create the necessary files I need and begin my code.

a. I am continuing this project session. I decided to setup a main project3 file with a class and main function, and the command line arguments will be the commands. This way the program will run like the previous 2 projects. I also looked at the what the program is doing itself, which is using a B Tree for indexing. I understand this concept as I recently learned about this in Databases in addition to OS so logically I think I understand what it's doing.
b. This project session I plan to write the code that takes in commands and sends the program to the corresponding function.

a. I am still in the same project session, but I have made more progress. My code is now able to accept a command from the commandline and go to the correspodning function to carry out the command. As far as the project itself, I have no new thoughts about it.
b. This part of my project session, I plan to learn a little more about how the index file works and write the code for the create command. I'm also a little confused on how the blocks work so I will look into that more as well.

a. I am finishing up this project session. I created the create command if statement and started on the create function. I also coded the function to print the usage menu. Next session I plan on making good progress on most if not all functions. 

# May 11 12:28am
a. I am now starting a new project session. Since last time, I re-read the project 3 document and realized that an index file represents a B-Tree, so in order to finish my create function I need to create a class for a B-Tree. 
b. This project session I plan on finishing the create function, and with that the B-Tree class and any other classes needed for the create command to work.
